# Prisoner-s-Dilemma-Spatial-games
The Prisoner’s Dilemma refers to the following situation: Two criminals who committed a crime
together are being interrogated by the police in separate rooms. Each prisoner has a choice to
either cooperate with their partner in crime and stay silent, or to be a defector and rat on their
partner to gain favor with the police. The outcome of the interrogation depends on the choices
made by the two prisoners:
• If both prisoners cooperate with each other and stay silent, then each prisoner only goes to
prison for a short time (because there is little evidence against them).
• If both prisoners defect (i.e., rat on each other), then they both get long sentences.
• If one prisoner stays silent in an attempt to cooperate, but the other defects, then the one
who testifies gets a big reward: immunity from prosecution. On the other hand, the person
who stayed silent gets a long sentence.

In this Repository, I will achieve the same results using python with Jupyter NoteBook
